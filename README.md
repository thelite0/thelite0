# Hi, I'm Lite! 👋

I’m a developer with a diverse range of interests and projects. From backend systems to front-end interfaces, I tackle challenges across the entire stack. Currently, I'm diving into game and web development.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- **Vixeon**: A minimalist, high-performance chat app focused on speed and privacy. I’m building it from scratch with the goal of cutting out unnecessary features and bloat.
- **Game Engine**: I’m developing my own game engine, starting from the ground up. It’s an ambitious project, but I’m pushing forward one line of code at a time.

## 🔨 Tech Stack
- **Primary languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#
- **Experience with**: C++, Java
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Next.js, Unity, Tailwind CSS, React
- **Tools**: Git, Docker

## 🔍 Things I Care About
- **Speed**: Whether it’s app performance or game mechanics, neither me or anybody else will use app that takes enternity to load.
- **Privacy**: I believe user should have more control over what data is shared.
- **Simplicity**: I’m all about cutting out the fluff and keeping things lean and functional.
